⚠ Unexpected build directory
The CLI tried to build your Storybook at /var/folders/_2/cscqnkkn689g1wrlvkpt3h380000gn/T/chromatic--12657-vaxWW8KbZ9GA
but instead it was built at /Users/calvinhemington/Desktop/boombox-design-system/apps/storybook/storybook-static
Make sure your "build-storybook" script forwards the --output-dir (-o) flag to the build-storybook CLI.

It appears you're using "npm run" which is known to cause this problem.
You can fix this by invoking build-storybook from your "build-storybook" script directly.
